Our telecom churn analysis leverages the random module for synthetic data generation, enabling us to simulate diverse customer scenarios. By employing this versatile tool, we emulate various factors influencing churn, such as usage patterns, subscription types, and customer demographics. Through strategic manipulation of random variables, our model captures the inherent uncertainty and complexity present in real-world telecom datasets. This approach allows us to explore a wide range of potential churn scenarios and devise proactive retention strategies effectively. By generating synthetic data with the random module, we ensure the robustness and adaptability of our analysis, empowering telecom companies to make informed decisions in mitigating customer churn
